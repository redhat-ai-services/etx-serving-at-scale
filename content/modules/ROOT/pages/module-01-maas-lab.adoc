= 3Scale API Gateway

In this module, you will learn how to configure 3Scale API Gateway to give access to the models previously deployed in the first lab.



[#3scale-overview]
== 3Scale Overview

=== Connection to 3Scale Admin Portal

3Scale is an API management platform that provides a way to manage, secure, and analyze APIs. It allows you to create and manage API keys, set up rate limits, and monitor API usage.

To connect to the 3Scale admin portal, you will need the admin_user and admin_password values. They can be found in the `system-seed` secret in the `3scale` namespace.

* From a Terminal (in your VSCode workbench) log into OpenShift.
+
[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u {user} -p {password} --server={openshift_api_url}
----
+
(approve the certificate when prompted to allow insecure connections)

* Now that you are logged in, you can get the secret values with the following commands:
+
[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get secret system-seed -n 3scale -o template='{{range $key, $value := .data}}{{if or (eq $key "ADMIN_USER") (eq $key "ADMIN_PASSWORD")}}{{printf "%s: " $key}}{{ $value | base64decode }}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}'
----

Now you can log into the 3Scale admin portal at https://maas-admin.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://maas-admin.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank] using the credentials you just retrieved.

You will be prompted by a wizard window. Close it by clicking on the top right corner of the screen.

=== Enabling the Developer Portal

Developer Portal allows API providers to create a customizable, branded interface for onboarding developers, sharing API documentation, and managing access credentials. It supports content management, theming, and integration with backend services to streamline API consumption.

A user was already created for you in 3Scale in (Audience->Accounts->Listing), but you still need to configure the developer portal to allow users to access it.

* On the Audience section, got to Developer Portal->Settings->Domains & Access.
+

* The Developer Portal Access Code is used to control the access the developer portal. Simply delete it and click on `Update Account`. to remove the access code and allow anyone to access the developer portal, although they will still need to authenticate.

[#creating-a-new-product]
== Creating a new Product in 3Scale

You are ready to create a new Product based on the model you deployed in the previous module. To do that we are going to use the 3Scale operator. This will show you how you can fully automate the deployment of new models in your service.

The order of deployment is 

1. Create Product that the user can consume
2. Create Backend that points to the hosted model 
3. Create API document the contains the
4. Create API proxy

[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]

=== Navigating to the 3Scale Operator

* In the OpenShift Web Console, click on the `Operators` menu on the left side of the screen, then select `Installed Operators`. On the top `Project` dropdown, select the `3scale` project.
+

* Click on `Red Hat Integration - 3scale` operator from the list.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-operator-item.png[]

* You will be taken to the operator details page.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-operator-details.png[]

=== Creating a Backend

The first element you need to create is a Backend. This is the service that will be used by the Product to connect to the model endpoint.

* Click on the `3scale Backend` tab. You will see that there is already a backend created for the `granite-3dot2-8b-instruct` model.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-backend.png[]

* To deploy the new backend for TinyLlama, click on the `Create Backend` button.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-create-backend.png[]

* In the YAML view, replace the default content with the following YAML and click on create. This will create a new backend for the `TinyLlama` model.
+
[source,yaml,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kind: Backend
apiVersion: capabilities.3scale.net/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: tinyllama
  namespace: 3scale
spec:
  name: TinyLlama
  privateBaseURL: 'https://tinyllama-llm-hosting.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}'
  systemName: tinyllama
----

* After a few seconds, you should see the new backend in the list of backends.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-backend.png[]


* You can also switch to the 3Scale Admin Portal and check that the new backend is listed there.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-backend-portal.png[]

=== Creating a Product

We are now ready to create the new Product that will use this backend. The Product is the element that will be used by the users to access the model.

* In the OpenShift Console, on the 3Scale operator, click on the `3scale Product` tab. You will see that there is already a product created for the `granite-3dot2-8b-instruct` model.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-product.png[]

* To deploy the new product for TinyLlama, click on the `Create Product` button.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-create-product.png[]

* In the YAML view, replace the default content with the following YAML and click on create. This will create a new product for the `TinyLlama` model. You can see that the configuration is more complex than the backend, as it includes the mapping rules, policies, and methods that will be used by the product.

* After a few seconds, you should see the new product in the list of products.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-product.png[]

* You can also switch to the 3Scale Admin Portal and check that the new product is listed there.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-product-portal.png[]

* When a new Product is created, it is only available in a "staging" environment. This means that it is not yet available to the users. You need to publish it to make it available. This can be done in the 3Scale Admin Portal, or using the operator. In the operator view, click on the `ProxyConfig Promote` tab.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-proxyconfig-promote.png[]

* Click on the `Create ProxyConfigPromote` button.
+
[.bordershadow]

----

* In the 3Scale Admin Portal, you can see that the product is now published to production. Got to `Products`, select the `TinyLlama` product and go to `Integration->Configuration`. You can see that the `Production APIcast` environment is now available.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-proxyconfig-applied.png[]

* We must now create the API Documentation for the new product. We will again use the 3Scale operator to do this. Click on the `ActiveDoc` tab and click on the `Create ActiveDoc` button.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-create-activedoc.png[]

* In the YAML view, replace the default content with the following YAML and click on `Create`. This will create the API documentation for the product. As the APIDoc can be complex, we already created a JSON file that contains the API documentation for the `TinyLlama` model and we will only need to reference it in the YAML.
+

----

* Finally, we must subscribe our user to this new product, as we did previously for Granite. Again, this is normally something you would automate as part of a deployment of a new product, but here we are going to do it in the 3Scale Admin Portal. Go to `Audience->Listing`, select `user1` account.
+
[.bordershadow]

* Select the `Default` Plan and click on `Create subscription`.
+
[.bordershadow]

* `user1` is now subscribed to the `TinyLlama` product. You can see that the subscription is active and the plan is set to `Default` Plan.
+

=== Testing the Product

You can now test this new Product in the same way you did for `Granite` in the previous module.

* Connect to the Developer Portal at `https://maas.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://maas.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain},window=_blank]` and log in using your credentials.

* Click on the `See your Applications and their credentials` link on the front page.

* Click on the `Create new application` button.

* Select the `TinyLlama` service.

* Enter a name for your application, for example `TinyLlama application`. Click on `Create Application`.

* Your application has been created. You can see the Endpoint URL you can use to connect to the API, the name of the model you must use in your requests, and the API key that has been generated for you. You can now use this key to access the API.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/03-3scale-tinyllama-info.png[]

* You can now test the API using the `curl` command in your terminal. Open a terminal in your VSCode environment (or on your laptop) and run the following command, replacing the placeholder values with the ones you got from the previous step:
+
[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -X 'POST' \
    '___ENDPOINT_URL___/v1/completions' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer ___API_KEY___' \
    -d '{
    "model": "___MODEL_NAME___",
    "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
    "max_tokens": 15,
    "temperature": 0
}'
----

Example:

[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://tinyllama-maas-apicast-production.apps.cluster-br294.br294.sandbox5291.opentlc.com:443/v1/completions' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer 5924457cf136e9906c5c98cc5924ab7a' \
    -d '{
    "model": "tinyllama/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0",
    "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
    "max_tokens": 15,
    "temperature": 0
}'
----

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new Product in 3Scale and connected it to the `TinyLlama` model.
