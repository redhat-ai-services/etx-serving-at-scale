= Model as a Service (MaaS)


== What is it
A solution providing AI models as a *Service* to a larger audience

* IT serves common models centrally or remotely
** Generative AI focus but applicable to any model type
** Centralized pool of hardware 
** Platform Engineering for AI
** AI model management (versioning, regression testing, etc)
* Models made available through API Gateway
* Developers consume provided models, build AI applications
** For end users (private assistants, etc) 
** To improve products or services through AI functionality
* Shared Resources keeps costs down
* Avoids shadow IT and associated costs
* Can be used to prevent data leakage

== Why do Customers need it
Self-Service is good for small teams with plentiful resources but struggles when teams or team siezes grow

Throwing GPUs at the problem is wateful and ineffective

* Few people know how to use them correctly and effectively
* Leads to duplication and underutilization of hardware
* Leads to high costs

*_Most people want an Model serving endpoint, not a GPU_*

Developed by the BU CAI team using RH Technology stack

== Overview

The MaaS solution stack consists of Red Hat OpenShift AI, API Gateway and SSO.

 * Keycloak – Identity provider (IdP) for OAuth2/OIDC authentication.
 * 3scale API Management – Secures and manages the API (model endpoint).
 * OpenShift AI (RHOAI) – Hosts your deployed AI model (via ModelMesh or custom service).
 * User/Client – Requests a token from Keycloak, then calls the model via 3scale using that token.

=== Logical Architecture of MaaS to move to capability focus instead of product focus

== How do we deliver MAAS to customers

=== Things to Consider
* 3Scale is end of life  *(Confirmed)* 
* Red Hat Connectivity Link isn't GA or functionally equivilent
* LLMd is on the roadmap
* Engineering is working on a MAAS product (early days)
* Customer often have their own API gateways
* Customer often have their own oidc/auth/authz/security providers

=== Delivery Approach
* We must assume customers will have their own API gateway and security providers
* We will have to work *_WITH_* the customers teams to deploy a MAAS solution
** API G/W team
** Security Team
** Logging and Metrics
* This will be done collaboratively with the customer as part of an *AI Incubator* engagement.

The next section goes into more techical details around what's required.
