= Deploying a Model with vLLM on a single node with multiple GPUs

In this section will will deploy a https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct[Granite 3.3 8B Instruct] model using vLLM.

For our Model Server we will be deploying a vLLM instance using a model packaged into an OCI container with ModelCar.

[NOTE]
====
ModelCar is Generally Available as of OpenShift AI 2.16.

ModelCar is a great option for smaller models like our 8B model.  While it is still a relatively large container (15Gb) it is still reasonable to easily pull into a cluster.

Treating the model as an OCI artifact allows us to easily promote the model between different environments using customers existing promotion processes.  By contrast, dealing with promoting models between S3 instances in different environments may create new challenges.
====

== Lab: Creating the vLLM Instance

. Open the https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[OpenShift AI Dashboard] and select the `vllm` project from the list of Data Science Projects

+
image::03-datascience-project.png[vLLM Project]

. Select the `Models` tab and click `Select single-model` if it hasn't already been set for you.

+
[NOTE]
====
Multi-model serving (Model Mesh) was depreciated in OpenShift AI 2.19 and will be removed in a future release.

All ServingRuntimes that were previously available with the Multi-model serving platform are now available as single-model serving runtimes.
====

+
image::03-single-model-serving.png[Single Model]

. Select `Deploy model`

+
image::03-deploy-model.png[Deploy Models]

. Enter the following information:

+
[source,yaml]
----
Model deployment name: granite-8b
Serving runtime: vLLM NVIDIA GPU ServingRuntime for KServe
Deployment mode: Advanced
Number of model server replicas to deploy: 1
Model server size: Custom
CPUs requested: 4 Cores
CPUs limit: 8 Cores
Memory requested: 8 GiB
Memory limit: 16 GiB
Accelerator: NVIDIA GPU
Number of accelerators: 1
Make deployed models available through an external route: Checked
Require token authentication: Unchecked
----

+
[WARNING]
====
In OpenShift AI 2.22, a validate was added to the Requests/Limits for the model server which prevents you from entering a value for the Request if it is less than the Limit.  This means that you must enter the value for the Limit first, and then you can enter the value for the Request.

Feel free to vote/follow the feature request https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHAIRFE-483[RHAIRFE-483] to help us improve this experience.
====

+
image::03-deploy-model-single-gpu.png[Model Options]

+
[NOTE]
====
OpenShift AI provides a deployment option of `Advanced` and `Standard`.  The `Advanced` option uses KNative Serverless and Service Mesh (Istio) to deploy the model server.  The `Standard` option is also know as a `RawDeployment` and uses standard Kubernetes Deployment objects.

The `Advanced` option allows you to configure advanced scaling capabilities such as Scale to Zero and allows you to autoscale the number of replicas based on the number of queued requests.

The `Standard` option provides more limited scaling capabilities which includes scaling based on the CPU/Memory utilization of the model server.  This is of limited use for LLMs since the bottleneck of the workload is dependent on the GPU resources.
====

. In the `Source model location` section, choose the option to `Create connection`.  Enter the following information:

+
[source,yaml]
----
Connection type: URI - v1
Connection name: granite-3-3-8b-instruct
URI: oci://quay.io/redhat-ai-services/modelcar-catalog:granite-3.3-8b-instruct
----

+
image::03-deploy-model-data-connection.png[URI Connection]

+
[TIP]
====
The Dashboard provides an data connection option for `OCI compliant registry - v1` which we use instead of the URI option.  The OCI option helps to automatically format the `oci://` prefix for the URI and will also give us an option to setup pull secrets for the container registry.

However, the pull secrets are currently not optional and we don't need it since our ModelCar image is public. Additionally, the OCI option does have a few other requirements that aren't super intuitive and should be improved in the future.

If you do wish to use the OCI option, you can simply set the pull secret as an empty object `{}`.
====

+
[NOTE]
====
You can find the image container for our model https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/modelcar-catalog/[here] alongside other ModelCar images that you can try.

Additionally, the source for building these ModelCar images can be found on https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/modelcar-catalog/[GitHub].

For more information on ModelCar see the KServe https://kserve.github.io/website/latest/modelserving/storage/oci/[Serving models with OCI images] documentation.
====

. Click `Deploy` to deploy the model.

+
[TIP]
====
A copy of the image has already been pulled onto the GPU node to help speed up deploying the model, but deploying LLMs can take quite some time.

KServe uses KNative Serverless to manage the model servers which has a default timeout of 10 minutes which means that if the model server takes longer than 10 minutes to deploy it will automatically terminate the pod and mark it as failed.

You can extend the timeout by adding the following annotation to the `predictor` section of the `InferenceService`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: granite-8b
spec:
  predictor:
    annotations:
      serving.knative.dev/progress-deadline: 30m
----
====

. After creating the model serving instance, check the pods in the `vllm` namespace.  You should see a pod called `granite-8b-predictor-00001-deployment-*`

+
[source,shell,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n vllm
----

+
[NOTE]
====
Note that there are is an init container that helps to validate the model files are present on the ModelCar container. Additionally, the pod has four containers.  The main container, `kserve-container` is the vLLM container that is responsible for serving the model.  This container will take some time to startup while the rest go to ready fairly quickly.
====

. Next, check the logs of the pod the `kserve-container` container.

+
[source,shell,role="execute"]
----
oc logs -l serving.knative.dev/service=granite-8b-predictor -n vllm --follow
----

+
You can exit the logs by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

+
You will find that the pod with eventually fail with the following error message.

+
[source,options="wrap"]
----
ERROR 07-16 07:47:09 [core.py:387] ValueError: To serve at least one request with the models's max seq len (131072), (20.00 GiB KV cache is needed, which is larger than the available KV cache memory (3.84 GiB). Based on the available memory,  Try increasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or decreasing `max_model_len` when initializing the engine.
----

+
vLLM is failing to start because it does not have enough vRAM to support the sizing of the default KV Cache. At this point, we can limit the size of the KV Cache using the `--max-model-len` parameter, or we can add additional GPU resources to the instance to increase the available vRAM. 

. From the `Models` tab of the OpenShift AI Dashboard, click on the three-dots menu on the right and then edit:

+
image::03-edit-model-config.png[Edit configuration]

. Update `Number of accelerators` to 2, and in the `Additional serving runtime arguments` add the following:

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
--tensor-parallel-size=2
----

+
image::03-deploy-model-parameters.png[Runtime Arguments]

. This will create an updated deployment called `granite-8b-predictor-00002-deployment-*`: 

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n vllm
----

+
[source,bash]
NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
granite-8b-predictor-00002-deployment-6f7cdc67bd-8lhkn   3/4     Running   0          17s
----

. Follow the logs of the pod until it is ready.

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc logs -l serving.knative.dev/service=granite-8b-predictor -n vllm --follow
----

+
[source,bash]

----

. (Optional) The OpenShift AI Dashboard created two KServe objects, a `ServingRuntime` and an `InferenceService`.  From the OpenShift Web Console, navigate to the `Home` > `Search` page and use the `Resources` drop down menu to search for and select those objects.  Spend a few minutes reviewing the objects created by the Dashboard.

== Lab: Checking our GPU usage

In this section we will explore what GPU resources are available to the vLLM pod and the resource utilization of the pod.

. To rsh into the pod, start out by getting the pod name:

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n vllm
----

+
[source,bash]
NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
granite-8b-predictor-00002-deployment-6f7cdc67bd-8lhkn   4/4     Running   0          17s
----

. Next, use the pod name to rsh into the pod:

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc -n vllm rsh granite-8b-predictor-00002-deployment-<sha>
----

. Finally, run the `nvidia-smi` command to view the available GPUs and the vRAM utilization.

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
nvidia-smi
----

+

You should see two GPUs available to the pod, and the majority of the vRAM being utilized.

== Lab:Testing vLLM Endpoints

Finally, we will access the Swagger docs page to test our vLLM endpoint.

. To start we will need to find the endpoint URL for the served model.  From the OpenShift AI Dashboard, navigate to the Models tab and click on the `Internal and external endpoint details` to find the URL.

+
image::03-deploy-model-route.png[Model endpoint]

+
[NOTE]
====
Our vLLM instance does not create a normal OpenShift route since we are deploying with "Advanced" (aka Serverless mode) so you won't find it under the normal `Networking` > `Routes` menu.  

Instead it creates a KNative Serving Route object which can be found in `Serverless` > `Serving` or with the following:

----
oc get routes.serving.knative.dev -n vllm
----
====

. Use the `copy` option for the route found in the previous step and paste it into a new tab with `/docs` at the end to access a FastAPI Swagger Docs page for vLLM.

+
image::03-model-docs-page.png[Docs page]

. Use the `Try it out` option of the `GET /v1/models` endpoint to list the models being deployed by this server.  Note that the id for our model matches the name of the model server we created in the OpenShift AI Dashboard.

+
image::03-llm-docs-run-v1-models.png[V1 Modules]

+
[WARNING]
====
Running into a 404 error on the OCP web console after trying this?

There is a known issue that can cause the OCP Web console to stop responding after accessing the Swagger docs.  To get around this, try accessing the OCP Web console through an Incognito window or a different browser.
====

. Once you have the model name, find the `POST /v1/chat/completions` endpoint and use the `Try it out` and use the following as the Request body.

+
[source,json]
----
{
  "model": "granite-8b",
  "messages":[ 
    { 
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You're an helpful assistant."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Who is Michael Jordan?"
    }
  ]
}
----

+
You should receive a response with an answer to the question.
