== API Gateway Required Functionality

=== SSE Handling
Processing of SSE events for supporting streaming responses 
<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html>

=== Request Payload Transformation
* Outgoing requests need to be modified to add vLLM token tracking 

```
    stream_options={
                include_usage ==> Include usage on last response     
                continuous_usage_stats  ==> Include usage on each chunk
    }

```

* User ID headers to need to be added to requests   
* Mandatory corporate custom HTTP headers

=== Gathering metrics 
** Request/Response count
** Request/Response Latency
** Token counts per request
*** Token count for a prompt
*** Token count for a completion
*** Total token count


=== Prometheus Integration
** Kong example <https://developer.konghq.com/plugins/prometheus/>
** APISix example <https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/prometheus/> 

=== Validation
** OIDC validation
** Application/Developer Token validation

=== User Management




== API Gateway Optional Functionality

=== Rate Limiting
Prevent users from hammering LLMs

=== Request Prioritization
Ensuring prioritization for critical applications/users

=== Cost Management

=== Corporate Guardrails
Single point of entry for LLM requests
