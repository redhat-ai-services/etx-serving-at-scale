Model as a Service (MaaS) Security Checklist

1. Model Security

 * Sign and verify model artifacts (e.g., using sigstore, cosign)
 * Store models in a trusted registry or model repository
 * Scan models for malicious code or unexpected behavior
 * Use model provenance tracking (who trained, where, and how)
 * Implement AIBOM (AI Bill of Materials) for transparency
 * Monitor for model drift and adversarial inputs

2. Data Security

 * Encrypt data in transit (TLS/SSL)
 *  Encrypt data at rest (e.g., OpenShift + KMS integration)
 * Ensure differential privacy or anonymization if using real user data
 * Apply access controls on training and inference data

3. API & Endpoint Security

 * Enforce authentication (Keycloak, OAuth2, OIDC)
 * Use API Gateway (e.g., 3scale) for rate-limiting and throttling
 * Validate all input payloads to prevent injection attacks
 * Use service mesh (Istio or OpenShift Service Mesh) for secure service-to-service communication

4. Runtime & Infrastructure Security

 * Run models in isolated environments (containers with seccomp/AppArmor)
 * Use confidential containers or confidential computing (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV)
 * Monitor containers with runtime security tools (ACS - Advanced Cluster Security)
 * Regularly patch and update base images and OS

5. Authorization & Access Control

 * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in OpenShift for model owners and users
 * Implement multi-tenant isolation policies
 * Use scoped tokens for API access with expiration

6. Audit & Monitoring

 * Enable audit logs for API access, model invocation, and data access
 * Integrate with SIEM/logging (e.g., OpenShift + EFK stack, Splunk, or Graylog)
 * Monitor resource usage for anomalies (e.g., unexpected model calls)

7. Compliance & Risk

 * Conduct AI risk assessments (NIST AI RMF or ISO 42001)
 * Ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, COPPA, etc.)
 * Maintain documentation for AI lifecycle and incident response

8. Supply Chain Security
 
 * Use SBOM tools for dependencies (e.g., Syft, Grype)
 * Scan third-party libraries used in models and inference services
 * Validate model and container integrity during deployment (admission controllers)

9.  OpenShift AI-Specific Recommendations
 
 * Use OpenShift GitOps to enforce policy-as-code for model deployment
 * Apply OpenShift ACS (Advanced Cluster Security) policies to enforce build/deploy/runtime rules
 * Secure model routes with OpenShift Routes + TLS + Keycloak Authz
 * Use sealed secrets or Vault for credentials
