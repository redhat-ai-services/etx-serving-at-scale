= Data Parallelism

== Data Parallelism Overview

Data Parallelism (DP) replicates the model across multiple GPUs. Data batches are evenly distributed between GPUs and the data-parallel GPUs process them independently. While the computation workload is efficiently distributed across GPUs, inter-GPU communication is required in order to keep the model replicas consistent between training steps.

The two types of data parallelism are: 

* DataParallel supports distributed training on a single machine with multiple GPUs.

** The default GPU, GPU 0, reads a batch of data and sends a mini batch of it to the other GPUs.
** An up-to-date model is replicated from GPU 0 to the other GPUs.
** A forward pass is performed on each GPU and their outputs are sent to GPU 0 to compute the loss.
** The loss is distributed from GPU 0 to the other GPUs for the backward pass.
** The gradients from each GPU are sent back to GPU 0 and averaged.

* DistributedDataParallel supports distributed training across multiple machines with multiple GPUs.

** The main process replicates the model from the default GPU, GPU 0, to each GPU.
** Each GPU directly processes a mini batch of data.
** The local gradients are averaged across all GPUs during the backward pass.

DDP is recommended because it reduces communication overhead between GPUs, efficiently utilizes each GPU, and scales to more than one machine.

== When to Use Data Parallelism

Data parallelism significantly reduces training time by processing data in parallel, and it is scalable to the number of GPUs available. However, synchronizing results from each GPU can add overhead.

* When you have enough GPUs to replicate the entire model
* When you need to scale throughput rather than model size
* In multi-user environments where isolation between request batches is beneficial
