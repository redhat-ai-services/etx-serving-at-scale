== Keycloak and 3Scale

Use Keycloak to authenticate users and then obtain a token to use with Red Hat 3scale API Management. This is a common architecture where Keycloak handles identity and access management (IAM), while 3scale handles API rate limiting, analytics, and monetization.

Here are the high-level steps to configure Keycloak, 3scale, and OpenShift AI to authenticate and call a model through 3scale, ensuring secure, managed access to your AI model endpoints:

✅ Architecture Overview
Keycloak – Identity provider (IdP) for OAuth2/OIDC authentication.

3scale API Management – Secures and manages the API (model endpoint).

OpenShift AI (RHODS) – Hosts your deployed AI model (via ModelMesh or custom service).

User/Client – Requests a token from Keycloak, then calls the model via 3scale using that token.

🔧 Step-by-Step Configuration
🧩 1. Set up Keycloak as an Identity Provider
Deploy Keycloak (if not already available):

Use OpenShift Operator Hub or an external instance.

Create a Realm:

Name it (e.g., ai-realm).

Create a Client (for your API consumer app):

Client ID: ai-client

Access Type: confidential

Valid Redirect URIs: * (for testing) or your app URL

Enable Standard Flow and Client Credentials

Save the Client Secret

Create Users/Roles (optional):

Add users and assign roles or groups to manage access policies.

🔐 2. Secure AI Model with OpenShift Route & Token Auth
Deploy the Model via RHODS:

Either use Jupyter + ModelMesh (recommended) or a custom Flask/FastAPI service.

Expose via Route:

Create a Route in OpenShift to expose the model endpoint.

Ensure it’s protected by an OAuth2 token (Keycloak) or make it internal.

Test endpoint locally with curl or Postman using a Bearer token.

🛡️ 3. Configure 3scale to Manage the AI Model API
Set up 3scale Admin Portal:

Login to 3scale and create a new API Product (e.g., ai-model-api).

Create Backend for Model Endpoint:

Define the backend pointing to the OpenShift model URL (e.g., https://model-service.myproject.apps.cluster/model/predict).

Create the Product:

Link the backend.

Set up application plans and methods (e.g., /predict).

Set up OpenID Connect Auth (OIDC):

Go to [Integration > Settings] of the product.

Enable OpenID Connect.

Use Keycloak Realm Info:

Issuer: https://<keycloak-host>/realms/ai-realm

JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URL: https://<keycloak-host>/realms/ai-realm/protocol/openid-connect/certs

Define Mapping Rules:

Match API paths (e.g., /predict) to usage metrics.

Update API Gateway Configuration:

Promote the staging config to production.

🧪 4. Test the Workflow
Get an access token from Keycloak:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST 'https://<keycloak-host>/realms/ai-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  -d 'client_id=ai-client' \
  -d 'client_secret=<your-secret>' \
  | jq
Call the model via 3scale gateway:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST 'https://<3scale-api-gateway-url>/predict' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": [your_input_data]}'
3scale validates the token via OIDC, applies rate limits, and proxies to the model.

🧠 Optional Enhancements
Use Red Hat SSO (Keycloak) as a managed offering if available.

Configure Keycloak client scopes for more granular claims.

Apply 3scale rate limits, alerts, and API analytics.

Enable logging/monitoring via OpenShift Logging/Grafana/Prometheus.
